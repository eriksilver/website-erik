##Seven Simple Ways to Serve Your New App

For a project I was working on recently I needed a way to deploy my static files. I didn't have a server built into my project (yet), but I needed to review my site locally and share it on the web.

Static vs Dynamic Sites?
Static sites can be served from your computer or a static site generator (e.g. Github Pages)
* An example is this blog.
Static sites serve content directly from the file-system (which is built via the site-generator).
An advantage of static sites is speed and simplicity because the files are ready in the file-system.

Dynamic sites require a web server
* An example is a Wordpress site which needs PHP and MySQL to run on the server.
Dynamic sites generate content from the server with each page request.
They can perform slower and are more error prone because files are repeatedly being generated by the server.
A primer on static vs dynamic sites is [here](http://nilclass.com/courses/what-is-a-static-website/#29).


####Spin up a simple [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server)
This is a simple, no configuration server that can be installed with npm.
*  Run from the command line $: ````http-server````  

####Simple [python server](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/modules-in-python/how-to-use-simplehttpserver/)
Python includes this simple server module with no configuration required.
* Run from the command line $: ````python -m SimpleHTTPServer````

###BitBalloon
One of my favorite simple hosting sites. Free and paid options.  
* Drag and drop your file folder to get [started](http://BitBalloon.com).

####Use a text editor with a built in server or live preview, like Webstorm or [Brackets.io](http://www.brackets.io)
Brackets is a lightweight, open-source editor made by Adobe that is geared toward the design side of development. It includes a "Live Preview" option with Chrome that automatically updates your view as you code. I've heard good things, and I want to try this out soon!
* Install with Homebrew or download [here]((http://www.brackets.io):

####[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
A go-to source for static sites. Easy to setup and get started. Great for Jeykll blogs (like this one!).
* Get started [here](https://pages.github.com/)

####[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)
Heroku is another go-to option for free hosting with their basic plan. While they are geared toward  dynamic websites, there are ways to use Heroku for static sites as well.
Here are a couple of options:
* Static sites built in [Ruby](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/static-sites-ruby)
* Tricking Heroku into thinking your static files are a [PHP app](https://gist.github.com/wh1tney/2ad13aa5fbdd83f6a489)

####Divshot
Divshot, now acquired by Firebase, specializes in static website hosting and is geared toward scaling web apps. They have good blog and a free plan to get you started.
I haven't tried them yet, but it looks fantastic.
