title: Static Server and Deployment Options

###Add title

For a project I was working on recently I needed a way to deploy my static files. I didn't have a server built into my project (yet), but I needed to review my site locally and on the web.

Static vs Dynamic Sites?
Static sites can be served from your computer or a static site generator (e.g. Github Pages)
* An example is this blog.
Static sites serve content directly from the file-system (which is served via the site-generator).
Static sites have an advantage of speed and simplicity because the files are ready in the file-system.

Dynamic sites require a website server (e.g. [Blue Host](http://www.bluehost.com/track/codenotes_silver/))
* An example is a Wordpress site which needs PHP and MySQL to run on the server.
Dynamic sites generate content from the server with each page request
Dynamic sites can perform slower and are more error prone with because files are repeatedly being generated by the server.
A good primer on static vs dynamic (with some Wordpress info included) is [here]( http://nilclass.com/courses/what-is-a-static-website/#29)

Here are some ideas - hat tip to [Ryan Balfanz](http://www.ryanbalfanz.com) for brainstorming with me on this.


####Spin up a simple [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server)
This is a simple, no configuration server that can be installed with npm.
*  Run with: ````http-server````  

####Simple [python server](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/modules-in-python/how-to-use-simplehttpserver/)
Python includes this simple server module with no configuration required.
* Run with: ````python -m SimpleHTTPServer````

####Use a text editor with a built in server or live preview, like [Brackets.io](http://www.brackets.io)
Brackets is a lightweight, open-source editor made by Adobe that is geared toward the design side of development. It includes a "Live Preview" option with Chrome that automatically updates your view as you code. I've heard good things, and I want to try this out soon!
* Download [here]((http://www.brackets.io):

####[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
A go-to source for static sites. Easy to setup and get started. Great for Jeykll blogs (like this one!).
* Get started [here](https://pages.github.com/)

####[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)
Heroku is a go-to options for free hosting with their basic plan. While they can handle dynamic websites, there are ways to use Heroku for static sites as well.
Here are a couple of options:
* Static sites built in [Ruby](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/static-sites-ruby)
* Tricking Heroku into thinking your static files are a [PHP app](ttps://gist.github.com/wh1tney/2ad13aa5fbdd83f6a489)

####Divshot
Divshot specializes in static website hosting and is geared toward scaling web apps. They have good blog and a free plan to get you started.
I haven't tried them yet, but it looks fantastic.

What do you use to serve static sites?


Need to add bluehost disclosure.
