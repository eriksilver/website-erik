This To-Do app is unique in that tasks will disappear if they are not completed within seven days.

  <li>A new state accessible in the navigation to view completed tasks</li>
</ol>

## Stack

<ul>
  <li>AngularJS</li>
  <li>Firebase</li>
</ul>

## User Stories

<ol>
  <li>As a user, I want to enter, archive, and delete tasks.</li>
  <li>As a user, I want to view active and completed/archived tasks.</li>
  <li>As a user, I want the app to archive active tasks after seven days.</li>
</ol>

## Results

The To-Do App was the first app that I built and a good place to start to learn the basics of Angular and how to integrate a database, Firebase, in this case.
